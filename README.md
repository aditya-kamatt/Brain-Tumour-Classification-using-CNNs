# Brain Tumor Classification using CNNs

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying brain tumor images. The model is trained to identify whether MRI brain scan images show the presence of a tumor or not.

## Features
- Brain tumor detection using CNN-based deep learning models.
- Uses a dataset of MRI images for training and validation.
- Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Technologies
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-kamatt/Brain-Tumour-Classification-using-CNNs.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook to load the dataset, train and test the CNN model.

The dataset should be organized into train and test directories, each containing labeled subdirectories (tumor and no_tumor).

## Results
The trained CNN model will classify MRI images as either "Tumor" or "No Tumor" with high accuracy.
